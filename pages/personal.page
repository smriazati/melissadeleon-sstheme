                    <p>Our most thorough and valuable part of the process. During this phase, we gather your inspirations, learn about your story and lifestyle, and develop your personalized Style Profile.

                    <p>We host this phase in a comfortable, well-appointed venue, allowing you to enjoy a sense of intentional relaxation, respite, and care.</p>
                    <p>We’ll use these findings to curate your personalized MdS Virtual Style Profile. Your Style Profile will be available on a password-protected client portal for you to continuously refer to and interact with, and includes your colors, body type, measurements, mood board, and shoppable links, all in one safe space.</p>

                    <p>We will also identify items in your wardrobe to eliminate, as well as any gaps to be filled. We’ll discuss an appropriate clothing budget, and help create a shopping list as you walk forward into your new image.</p>
                    <p>All notes, photos of outfit pairings, and shoppable links of suggested wardrobe additions will be uploaded to your Style Profile for you to refer back to.</p>
